# vue blog demo

A project I wrote for a bootcamp to teach beginning programmers how to use the vue framework. This application demonstrates all CRUD operations and lets a user login using a simple token based authentication method. A backend was also provided at https://github.com/Jcuperus/vuejs-blog-demo-laravel

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
